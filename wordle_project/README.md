## How to Play

Follow the game's on-screen instructions to play Wordle. You'll need to guess the hidden five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. Each letter you guess will be color-coded to indicate correctness:

- Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
- Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
- Gray: Incorrect letter.

You can make up to 6 attempts to guess the word. Try to solve it in as few attempts as possible!
